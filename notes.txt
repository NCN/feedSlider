*** HTML NOTES ***

Determining caption size:

Slideshow-container
width: 550px

Caption
width: 333px
bottom: 0px
left: 110px

Image:
width: 333

Calculating caption 'left:' coordinate:
(550-333) / 2 + 1 = 110


** Adjusting image size: **

jquery.galleriffic.js:
    var scaleHeight = 500;
    var maxWidth = 700;

css:
div.content {
	/* The display of content is enabled using jQuery so that the slideshow content won't display unless javascript is enabled. */
	display: none;
    margin-left:auto;
    margin-right:auto;
	/*float: right;*/
	width: 800px; /* width of the actual image area */ /* was 550 */
}

div.loader {
	position: absolute;
	top: 0;
	left: 0;
	background-image: url('loader.gif');
	background-repeat: no-repeat;
	background-position: center;
	width: 800px; /* was 550 */
	height: 502px; /* This should be set to be at least the height of the largest image in the slideshow */
}

div.slideshow a.advance-link {
	display: block;
	width: 800px; /* was 550 */
	height: 502px; /* This should be set to be at least the height of the largest image in the slideshow */
	line-height: 502px; /* This should be set to be at least the height of the largest image in the slideshow */
	text-align: center;
}
